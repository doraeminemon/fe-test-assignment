Todo:
  ☐ Home page: display overall weather from cities of a country (US or VN) -> List view
  ☐ Details page: when user click on a weather, display a new page with detailed weather information from that country
  ☐ Use a State Container (such as Redux) if you use ReactJS/VueJS
  ☐ you can use any design system: Bootstrap (Twitter), Materialize(Google), Carbon(IBM) or Ant-Design(Alibaba) ...
  ☐ Focus on component structure design (clean the logic, not duplicate the code)
  ☐ Focus on loading performance (how the HTML DOM are rendered, does it have unnecessary re-render?)
Advanced features:
  ☐ UnitTest
  ☐ Implement a server-side rendering for that SPA (use NodeJS based server or any: Java, Go...)
  ☐ That server will pre-render the HTML dom, JS and CSS chunking... (such like how NextJS does)
